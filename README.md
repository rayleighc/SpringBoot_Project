# SpringBoot-Assessment

●  	What did you like about this project?
Honestly, it is very challanging for me to build this Spring Boot application from scratch. 
Therefore, I have decided to "reverse engineer" the existing Web Project instead. 

●  	What did you struggle with in this project?
Figuring out which section of codes are useful for this assessment and edit them accordingly. 


●  	What would make your experience with this assessment better?
This is already a very good learning experience for me.
